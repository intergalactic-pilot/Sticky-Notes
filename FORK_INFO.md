# Fork Information

## About This Fork

This is an **enhanced community fork** of the original NoteBot project created by Federico Dossena.

**Current Version:** v2.0 | **Release Date:** December 23, 2025

### Why This Fork Exists

The original NoteBot is an excellent lightweight alternative to Microsoft Sticky Notes. However, its UI design dates back to 2016-2019 and doesn't reflect modern design standards. This fork aims to:

1. **Modernize the UI** - Bring Windows 11 Fluent Design aesthetics to NoteBot
2. **Improve usability** - Make interactions smoother and more intuitive
3. **Maintain the philosophy** - Keep it lightweight, open source, and privacy-focused

### Key Differences from Original
